### It's normal to struggle at first but it gets better!

&lt;img src="images/r_first_then_new.png" width="5136" /&gt;

  + My experience is that this stuff isn't super easy... but it gets better!
  + Mostly because of:
      + Awesome inclusive community that is always ready to help
      + Great documentation of existing packages and functions
      + Active blogosphere with use cases and examples
      + and much more!

+ Creating a Package

+ Documentation (`roxygen2` &amp; some `devtools`)

+ Unit Tests (with `testthat`)

+ Suggested Workflow

+ Some Resources

### Why Even Create an R Package

+ R packages are a wonderful way to make functions and datasets easily accessible for everyone

+ R really comes alive because of the many awesome packages that hundreds and hundreds of volunteers help create and maintain

+ It's a great way to become active in the R community &amp; give back

### Before we Start..

+ Creating packages is a process
    + There's no need to do everything at once!
    + Come up with milestones and focus on reaching them
    + Ask yourself: what's the main purpose of your package?
    + Should your package be about ...
         + Data Visualization
         + Implemetiation of statistical models
         + Wrapping an existing API
         + Data wrangling
         + ???
         + a little bit of everything?
  

+ Make sure you installed the latest R and Rstudio version

+ Install the following packages:


```r
pkgs &lt;- c("devtools", "roxygen2", "usethis", "testthat")
install.packages(pkgs)
```

---


### Choosing a Package Name

The `available` package will help check whether your desired package name is still.. well.. available:


```r
library(available)
available("datenguideR", browse = F)
```

&lt;img src="images/available.png" width="1512" /&gt;

### `usethis`


The purpose of `usethis` is to

&lt;img src="images/usethis.png" width="100" height="120" style="display: block; margin: auto 0 auto auto;" /&gt;

]

&gt; … automate repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development, both for R packages and non-package projects.

As you can guess by the description `usethis` is **VERY** useful for package creation and we will be using its functions quite often during development.

We're going to focus on two types of functions within `usethis` 
(although there are MANY more)

+ `use_*` 
    + for example `use_pipe` to include the pipe operator in your package
+ `create_*`
    + for example `create_from_github` which creates a local Git repository from GitHub

### Creating your first R Package

The following code will create a *minimal* R package:




]


.pull-right[


&lt;img src="images/usethis.png" width="100" height="120" style="display: block; margin: auto 0 auto auto;" /&gt;

]


```r
library(usethis)
create_package("~/git_projects/datenguideR")
```

All you need to do is specify a `path`. If it exists, it is used. If it does not exist, it is created, provided that the parent path exists.

But because *being tidy* is awesome we will be using `create_tidy_package`


```r
create_tidy_package("~/git_projects/datenguideR")
```

This function will also create a new package *but* it will also apply many great tidyverse conventions that will come in handy.


---

### Creating your first R Package

This is how your working directory should look like after creating a tidy package:


```r
-- R
-- tests
-- DESCRIPTION
-- NAMESPACE
-- datenguideR.Rproj
-- cran-comments.md
-- LICENSE.md
-- README.md
-- README.Rmd
```


We will talk about some of these in more detail soon but for now we will just accept them.


Finally, the following two lines of code will set up a GitHub repository for your package: 



```r
use_git()
use_github()
```

## Let's start adding functions to our package!

---


## Naming Functions

The `rOpenSci Package guide` states that:

&gt; Functions and arguments naming should be chosen to work together to form a common, logical programming API that is easy to read, and auto-complete.

So in the best case scenario you come up with a naming scheme in the following style:

+ `object_verb`

This scheme 

+ helps avoid namespace conflicts with packages that may have similar verbs
+ makes code readable and easy to auto-complete

For example `stringr` functions all start with `str_*` whereas `memer` functions all start with `meme_*`.

In our examples here we won't be using this naming style just for convenience but in your personal package you should absolutely consider using it!

## Creating your first Function in your Package

In order to get started with our first function we will create a new R script with the help of the `usethis` package:


```r
use_r("hello")
```

This will create and open an `hello.R` file in your package's R subfolder; the place where all the functions of your package will live!

Let's create an easy function that will add two numbers:


```r
add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

add(1, 2)
```

```
## [1] 3
```


So far so good.

## Documentation


Documentation is absolutely *central*.

.pull-right[


&lt;img src="images/roxygen2.png" width="100" height="120" style="display: block; margin: auto 0 auto auto;" /&gt;

It's basically the guidance for your users so they know how to use the functions within your package.

Or as Hadley Wickham puts it:

&gt; Documentation is one of the most important aspects of good code. Without it, users won’t know how to use your package, and are unlikely to do so. 

There is a built-in functionality within R to document pacakges: `.Rd` files that are stored in the `man` subdirectory of your package. These files use a syntax that is similar to latex.

Here to help us with documentation is `roxygen2` which *conveniently* creates a lot of the necessary files with its own more intuitive syntax style.

This is how documentation for our `add` function might look like:


```r
#' Add together two numbers.
#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A number.
#' @return The sum of \code{x} and \code{y}.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

Oi. This looks.. *different*. So what is actually going on here? 

Let's take a look at what this piece of roxygen code will generate.

add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```


This is a (very) short description of your function.

You might have noticed this odd code in front of the documentation: `#'`


```r
#' Add together two numbers.
*#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A number.
#' @return The sum of \code{x} and \code{y}.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

Roxygen comments start with this symbol in order to distinguish them from your usual comments (`#`)

Next up is the `@param` name descriptions for our functions.


```r
#' Add together two numbers.
#'
*#' @param x A number.
*#' @param y A number.
#' @return The sum of \code{x} and \code{y}.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

These lines of code describe the function’s inputs or *parameters*. The description usually documents what the parameter does, what the default inputs are (if any) and what the object type should ideally be (e.g., string, numeric vector etc.).

We continue with the `@return` name description.


```r
#' Add together two numbers.
#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A number.
*#' @return The sum of \code{x} and \code{y}.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

The `@return` tag simply describes the output from the function.

By using `\code{}` we can also make sure that the variables x and y are written in code font.

```r
#' Add together two numbers.
#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A number.
*#' @return The sum of `x` and `y`.
#' @export
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

The `@return` tag simply describes the output from the function.

However, since we used `create_tidy_package` we also automatically turned on *markdown* style syntax within our roxygen descriptions so this style of syntax is not actually necessary here.

Next up is the `@export` tag.


```r
#' Add together two numbers.
#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A number.
#' @return The sum of `x` and `y`.
*#' @export
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

This one is pretty straightforward. If you want your functions to be available to the user (and not just create an internal function to be used within the package) then it is crucial to add the `@export` tag.

Finally, the `@examples` tag.


```r
#' Add together two numbers.
#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A number.
#' @return The sum of `x` and `y`.
#' @export
*#' @examples
*#' add(1, 1)
*#' add(10, 1)
add &lt;- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

Adding examples to functions can *really* help your users figure out how your package is *meant* to be used.

With this, the roxygen code for your documentation is done. The last thing to do is converting your description to `.Rd` files so it can appear in the help file.

Luckily, with the help of the `devtools` package this step is *really* easy to do.

Just type in the following code:


```r
library(devtools)
document()
```


```r
Updating datenguideR documentation
Writing NAMESPACE
Loading datenguideR
Writing NAMESPACE
Writing add.Rd
```

If you now type `?add` into R it should render the development description that [we saw earlier](https://develop-rpkgs.netlify.com/#23).

Testing is really important to make sure your package is functioning as intended. As you keep developing and adding to your package code, keeping track of what might go wrong will become more and more complex. 

Unit tests will help you with identifying issues within your code so you can pinpoint what went wrong and where.

## Unit Testing

.pull-right[


&lt;img src="images/testthat.png" width="100" height="120" style="display: block; margin: auto 0 auto auto;" /&gt;

]

The basic setup of an unit testing is quite simple:

You write up example code with your package functions and define specific outputs that you expect. 

1. If they are met, great, the test is passed! 
2. If not, the test fails and you will know that something is wrong with your code and what failed.

To set up unit tests for your package with `testthat` you can simply run `use_testthat` (from our beloved `usethis` package):


```r
use_testthat()
```

This will create a folder `tests` and a subfolder `testthat`. This is the folder where your tests will live.

Since we created our package with `create_tidy_package` we don't need to run this part as this function automatically sets up `testthat`.

How do set up individual tests?

`usethis` got us covered again!

Simply run this code:


```r
use_test("hello")
```

This will create the following file:


```r
tests/testthat/test-hello.R
```

With this content:


```r
test_that("multiplication works", {
  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
})
```

## Unit Testing

]


.pull-right[


&lt;img src="images/testthat.png" width="100" height="120" style="display: block; margin: auto 0 auto auto;" /&gt;

]

Let's take this short code apart:


```r
test_that("multiplication works", {
  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
})
```

In the first line of code we can see the function `test_that` which is our main tool for unit tests.

The first argument of `test_that` describes what is supposed to be tested whereas the second argument encapsulates the code to be tested within a curly bracket `{}` environment.

Within this environment we write up our expectations with the help of `testthat`'s `expect_*` functions, of which there are many.

In this case we use `expect_equal` which is quite straightforward. The 1st argument should be equal to the 2nd argument and if it's not, the test fails.

First, we will test whether addition works as intended:


```r
test_that("addition works as intended", {
  
  result &lt;- add(5, 5)
  
  expect_equal(result, 10)
})
```

The test did not throw an error so this worked. Perfect!

```r
test_that("supplying string should throw error", {
  
  expect_error(
    add(5, "i_am_not_a_number")
    )
  
})

Again, this ran without problems. So everything went as we expected!

test_that("result is more than 15", {
  
  result &lt;- add(5, 5)

})
```


```r
Error: Test failed: 'supplying string should throw error' * 
`result` is not strictly more than 15. Difference: -5
```

Success! We failed! Since 5 + 5 is not more than 15 (it's actually 5 **less**) the test fails and we receive an informative error message as well.

It takes a little bit of creativity to foresee the many ways functions within your package might break.

In practice, writing the right kind of unit tests is considered sort of an [art](https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-unit-testing-second-edition) by some and a nuisance by others.

In any case though it is really important for writing robust code that can be relied upon.

The `devtools` package will help us test all of our unit tests at once by running the following code within your package project:


```r
test()
```

&lt;img src="images/test.png" width="1307" /&gt;

## Bringing it all together


We can also run `check` from `devtools` to test pretty much everything about our package:

And when your package passes all checks you get the sweet feeling of getting the following feedback:

## Suggested Workflow

 + Write some R code
 
 + Restart R session regularly 
 
 + Use `devtools::load_all()` to load your package
 
 + Write documentation for code
 
 + Run `document` regularly
 
 + Write unit tests for your code
 
 + Run `test` regularly
 
 + Run `check` every now and then

## Useful stuff that I wasn't able to mention yet

Add Package imports to `DESCRIPTION` with `usethis::use_package`:


```r
use_package("dplyr")
```


Set up continuous integration (in this case Travis CI) with the following code:


```r
use_travis()
```

Continuous integration allows you to run checks on your package code with various R versions and ensures that your package can run on different systems like Linux, Mac OSX &amp; Windows.

You can start reading about Travis CI here: [A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO TRAVIS-CI FOR R](https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/).

Set up an awesome website for your package (documentation) with the help of `pkgdown`.


```r
use_pkgdown()
```
